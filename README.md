This is just a place for me to test some CDK stuff. 
I'll grow things out into separate repos if necessary. 


## Basic Commands
 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk destroy`      remove/cleanup the CloudFormation template

## Functions
 * `createBucket`   Creates S3 Buckets (../lib/utils.ts)
